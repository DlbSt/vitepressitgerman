# IT German Vocabulary
I started to finally speak German at work and I quickly realized, that IT German is very specific. It is using a lot of english words, but the articles are not clear (if you are not a native speaker of course). That's why I started to make a list of these words.

This site is divided into three sections:
  - **[English words](/englishwords)** - This section contains english words, which are very often used in german language with their articles.
  - **[German words](/germanwords)** - German words somehow related to IT with Czech translation.
  - **[German verbs](/germanverbs)** - German verbs related to IT, also verbs which comes from English. Their past tenses are also included.

From the programmer perspective, I wanted to test VitePress, since it's based on Vue and Vite and normally I was using DocFx for creating such a webpage.
