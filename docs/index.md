# IT German Vocabulary
I started to finally speak German at work and I quickly realized, that IT German is very specific. It is using a lot of english words, but the articles are not clear (if you are not a native speaker of course). That's why I started to make a list of these words.

From the programmer perspective, I wanted to test VitePress, since it's based on Vue and Vite and normally I was using DocFx for creating such a webpage.
